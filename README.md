# Instructions
Vim setup for my computers!

Simply clone the repository and run ./everforest.sh

This will create a new directory containing a .vimrc file and a shell script that will replace the system .vimrc file with the new one. Feel free to delete the directory afterward.

#Step by step

1) git clone <repo link>

2) cd vimconfig && ./everforest.sh

3) cd .. && rm -rf vimconfig
